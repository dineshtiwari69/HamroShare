## FAQ

#### Is it Safe ?

Yes it is safe from the Account Stealing Aspect , but i don't know whats the CDSC's 
tos isfor the use of such Automation Software. Code is open-source , 
you can look at it yourself , build it yourself if you dont trust the existing build.

#### Are there any spooky backend API Linked With It ?

In the previous version , we were using meroshare's mobile api but now since they enabled cors restriction on their api , it wasn't possible without using serverside reverse proxy. We are using next.js api to bypass cors so technically there is a serverside involved .
