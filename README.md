HamroShare is a minimal web-application that lets you apply for IPOs from multiple mershare accounts at once.

Note: This programe was made with intention of learning more of ReactJS .
I am not a professional ReactJS Dev . Saying that , i hope i am not bullied for my way of code.😔

## FAQ

#### Is it Safe ?

Yes it is safe from the Account Stealing Aspect , but i don't know whats the CDSC's 
tos isfor the use of such Automation Software. Code is open-source , 
you can look at it yourself , build it yourself if you dont trust the existing build.

#### Are there any spooky backend API Linked With It ?

Trust me Broo, Everything Happens within a Client's Browser . Nothing Spooky.

#### How is it bypassing cors without using a Backend Proxy ?

Yeah for web api there was a cors issue , but i later switched to Meroshare's Mobile Application API .
